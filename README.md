# Wireframe-Event-Planner-Q4-2022

Upwork team's event planner website.

I have designed a total of five pages for an event planner website based on reseach and instructions from the team. I later added two examples of a mobile responsive version.

## How it's made:

**Tech used:** wireframe.cc

After collecting a few examples on Pintrest that would align with the client's demands, I sketched a few drafts, got the team's approval and then proceeded to use a wireframing software online to design a total of 7 pages. The team was pleased with the work after review.

## Optimizations:

Continue with making the pages responsive for different screen sizes.
